                  <h3 class="blog-heading">Here is some little knowledge regarding dental implants</h3>

                  <p class="blog-text">Today, if you lose one or more teeth, you now have options beyond bridges and partial dentures. One of those options is dental implants. Dental implants are titanium fixtures that are surgically screwed into the jaw bone and are used to anchor natural-looking false teeth. 
                    Since the bone grows around the implant, the result is a smile that not only looks completely natural, but one that feels and functions more like your own teeth. Dental implants are not only an option for patients who lose one tooth. Patients who are missing most, if not all, of their teeth can
                     greatly enjoy the benefits as well. Unlike dentures and removable bridges, which are usually loose and unstable, dental implants provide a permanent replacement. Implants look and feel much better than dentures and traditional removable bridges, and offer the same force for biting as bridges that are fixed in place. 
                    Since this is surgery, we spend the necessary time to inform you of all the details, including the risks, regarding dental implant surgery.</p>
